# PlajTime Hardware
This repository has the full history of PlajTime hardware development.
Before 19.9.2025 development took place in a single private repository and it was starting to be a little bit messy.
With beginning work on PlajTime's second prototype we made the decision to split the repos and make the code and design finally available.

## What about the older versions?
Every "release" will have it's own tag so you (and we) can look at the older versions and laugh how bad at engineering we are.
